<h3>What is the problem?</h3>
Almost eight percent of students get bullied during the school year, according to pacer.org. Bullying happens in hallways more than any other location, making the hallway a “Bully Hotspot”. Research shows that there is very little supervision in the hallway, between classes. Most students would not even stop the unkind act while they are staying focused on their next class. Therefore, searching for ways to eliminate the “Bully Hotspot” is necessary.

It is very hard to start kindness in hallways.

<h3>How can the “Bully Hotspot” become something positive?</h3>
Kindness is the solution! When students are kind, everyone feels welcome. Kindness can even start new friendships. Kindness can make everyone glad to be in that location and students would be more successful academically. Finally, kindness can reduce bullying. However hard it may seem, everyone should be kind.

<h3>What is our solution?</h3>
Our solution is to have pennies placed around school hallways. These pennies contain kind notes on the back of the penny. These notes encourage kindness in the school hallways. We have currently implemented this solution around the schools. Most of our pennies are taken by the students. Some students read the penny, but then return it. This could allow for multiple students to get the kind note.
